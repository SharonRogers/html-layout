	<p>Consider hiding the status bar - and all other app UI - while people are actively viewing full-screen media. If you hide the status bar, be sure to let people retrieve it (and the appropriate app UI) with a single tap. Unless you have a compelling reason to do so, avoid defining a custom, gesture to redisplay the status bar because users are unlikely to discover such a gesture or to remember it. More stuff just to make this longer and hopefully will look more and more like the image</p>
